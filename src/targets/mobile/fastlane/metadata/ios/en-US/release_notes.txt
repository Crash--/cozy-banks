Thanks for using Cozy Banks! In this new version you will find 2 advanced features : 
- a balance history graph available on the app home page : you will discover how well you manage to save for the last year!
- a better automatic categorization that learns from your manual recategorization : the next transactions will benefit from this learning!
These features are brand new and we are still working on it. To be the first to test it go and activate them in the app settings.
We also improved our notifications by email.
Enjoy and let us know what you think of these new features!
